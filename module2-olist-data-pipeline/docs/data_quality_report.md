## Issue Details

### order_payments — 9 flagged rows

| Issue | Count |
|---|---:|
| `zero_or_negative_payment_value` | 6 |
| `invalid_payment_type, zero_or_negative_payment_value` | 3 |

**What this means:** 9 payment records have a payment value of zero or less, and 3 of those also have an unrecognised payment type. Valid payment types are: `credit_card`, `boleto`, `voucher`, `debit_card`.

**Impact on star schema:** These 9 records are excluded from `fact_orders` total payment calculations.

---

### products — 611 flagged rows

| Issue | Count |
|---|---:|
| `null_category_name` | 609 |
| `null_dimensions` | 1 |
| `null_category_name, null_dimensions` | 1 |

**What this means:** 610 products have no Portuguese category name in the raw data (1.85% of the product catalogue). This means no English translation can be looked up either. 2 products also have missing dimension data (length/height/width).

**Impact on star schema:** These 611 products are excluded from `dim_products`. Their `category_name_english` would show as `unknown` but to keep the star schema clean they are excluded entirely.

---

### geolocation — 42 flagged rows

| Issue | Count |
|---|---:|
| `out_of_range_coordinates` | 42 |

**What this means:** 42 geolocation records have latitude/longitude coordinates outside Brazil's geographic bounds (lat: −33.75° to 5.27°, lng: −73.99° to −34.79°). These are likely data entry errors.

**Impact on star schema:** Geolocation is not yet joined into the star schema. These 42 rows are captured for reference.

## How to Query Issues

Each DQ table in BigQuery contains only flagged rows, with:
- One boolean column per check (e.g. `null_category_name = TRUE`)
- An `issues` column summarising all problems on that row as a comma-separated string

**Example — view all flagged products:**
```sql
SELECT product_id, issues
FROM `our-project-93971.olist_dev_data_quality.dq_products`
ORDER BY issues;
```

**Example — count issues by type across all payments:**
```sql
SELECT issues, COUNT(*) AS cnt
FROM `our-project-93971.olist_dev_data_quality.dq_order_payments`
GROUP BY issues
ORDER BY cnt DESC;
```
